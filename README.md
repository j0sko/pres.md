### A lightweight markdown presentation engine powered by [remark.js](https://remarkjs.com)

## Usage

All the relevant information to slide creation can be found on the [remark.js wiki](https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki).
However, changing the backgrounds is kind of convoluted, so here are some usefull classes from the [list](https://github.com/gnab/remark/blob/master/src/remark.less):

- `.remark-slide-container {background: x;}` for overall background
- `.remark-slide {background: x; shadow: x;}` for slide itself
