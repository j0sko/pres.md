## Usage

All the relevant information to slide creation can be found on the [remark.js wiki](https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki).
However, changing the backgrounds is kind of convoluted, so here are some usefull classes from the [list](https://github.com/gnab/remark/blob/master/src/remark.less):

- `.remark-container {background: x;}` for overall background
- `.remark-slide-scaler {box-shadow: x;}` for mid layer (only shadow is visible)
- `.remark-slide-content {background: x;}` for slide background
